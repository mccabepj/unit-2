        <h2>Where am I?</h2>
        <p>You found the 'Traffic Safety Data Explorer'. Welcome! </p>
            <p> This name right now is pretty much just a placeholder. For the final project, I would like to develop a 
                series of interactive maps that can be used by clients and colleagues. Right now mapping the data is pretty much limited to
                ArcGIS Online, and data is not effectively presented for pretty much any user. I would like to gradually change that.
            </p>
            <p>For now, this is data I began developing in GEOG 575 for the early labs. The proportional symbols represent total fatal crashes by metro area. 
                First note on this is that yes, I need to normalize this data if it is to be interesting. But I needed to submit something and I have been
                getting in my own way over and over. 
                <p>Two other bits: the metro area lat/long is determined by the mean center of fatal crashes in each 
                metro area. I saw this performed for population data once and thought it was cool. I also chose metro areas because I think we might be able to 
                mitigate our truly incredible traffic safety issues at a regional level rather than arbitrary city or state lines.  </p>
